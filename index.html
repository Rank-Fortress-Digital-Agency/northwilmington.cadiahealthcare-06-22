                    Healthcare: Quit smoking and drinking alcohol excessively
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did you know that smoking and drinking alcohol excessively are two of the worst things you can do to your health? In addition, they can also have a negative impact on your creativity. Here’s why:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smoking narrows the blood vessels in the brain, which reduces the amount of oxygen and glucose that reaches your brain cells. This decrease in oxygen and glucose can lead to a decline in cognitive function and decreased creativity. Smokers are up to 60% more likely to experience creativity problems than nonsmokers.1
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drinking alcohol excessively can also have a negative impact on creativity. Alcohol is a depressant, which means it slows down the activity of the central nervous system. This slowdown can lead to reduced cognitive function and decreased creativity. Additionally, alcohol abuse can cause long-term damage to the brain, including memory loss and reduced intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, if you want to improve your health and creativity, quitting smoking and drinking alcohol excessively are two of the best things you can do.
